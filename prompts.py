While surfing and whales are both associated with the ocean, the scale and proximity of the whale to the surfer in this photograph are not consistent with typical whale behavior or the physics of ocean waves. Whales are generally not found surfing in waves, and their size compared to the surfer seems disproportionate. Additionally, the water disturbance caused by a whale of that size would likely be much more significant than what is depicted here. The lack of any news coverage or scientific documentation of such an extraordinary event further suggests that this image is not an accurate representation of reality. ",

During a total solar eclipse, phenomena such as Baily's beads or the diamond ring effect may occur, which can result in spectacular visual displays as the moon covers or uncovers the sun. However, a cross shape made of light rays is not a typical occurrence and could instead be a sign of digital manipulation or an artifact of the photography process rather than a natural event. A natural cross shape in the sky during an eclipse would be an extraordinary claim requiring substantial evidence, which is not typically reported or documented by reliable sources in astronomy.""",
